Hey all! This is the first post I've written in a while, and the first that'll
be published on my personal site instead of a site like Medium. I have found
that I barely get anything from posting on Medium, and it's too gamified to
really enjoy posting there anyway. Hopefully having something low-stress like
this site will help me post more.


When I was first trying to get my personal site up and running, I was looking
at frameworks like Gatsby or [Jekyll][jekyll]. However,
[Gatsby looks like it's about dead][gatsby-dead] and I wasn't really looking to
use GitHub pages for Jekyll, as I don't know Ruby and don't really want to
learn. I came across a relatively new framework called [Astro][astro] in my
search and after getting things how I like them, I'm enjoying using it quite a
lot.

## What I like

### Content collections are really cool

I really love Astro's content collections. Rather than have pages fully defined
and routed like you normally might in a bespoke static site like this, you can
place your content in a designated folder at `/src/content`. You keep different
types of data in different folders, kinda like tables in a relational database,
and this data can be markdown files or just plain data in YAML or JSON.

If you're familiar with Obsidian's [Dataview][dataview] plugin, content
collections allow you to interact with your content in a very similar manner.
Astro bundles in a nice schema generation system called [Zod][zod] that lets
you define the schema for your content's frontmatter (or data if it's not a
markdown file). For example, here's the schema definition for this very note:

```ts
import { defineCollection, z } from "astro:content";

export const collections = {
    notes: defineCollection({
        type: 'content',
        schema: z.object({
            tags: z.array(z.string()).default([]),
            publishedOn: z.date().optional(),
            title: z.string(),
        }),
    }),
};
```
