Hey all! This is the first post I've written in a while, and the first that'll
be published on my personal site instead of a site like Medium. I have found
that I barely get anything from posting on Medium, and it's too gamified to
really enjoy posting there anyway. Hopefully having something low-stress like
this site will help me post more.

I built this site using a relatively new framework called
[Astro](https://astro.build), and so far I'm enjoying it a lot.
