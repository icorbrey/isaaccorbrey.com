## Outline

- Noise, noise, noise
- Notifications are fuckass bad
- PRs are awful for both implementers and reviewers
- Inconsistent and incomplete markdown implementations
- YAML pipelines are bad and UI pipelines are worse
- Boards do not surface useful information
- No way of seeing updates to your items or places where you're waiting on others
- No meaningful improvements made in the last 7 years
