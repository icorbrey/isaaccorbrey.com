  Rust is a fast, memory-safe programming language focused on performance and
  concurrency. It ensures safety without a garbage collector by enforcing
  ownership and borrowing rules at compile time. Ideal for systems programming,
  Rust prevents common errors like null pointer dereferences and race
  conditions.
